Objectives:

    1.Design and Develop Microservice: Develop a Python-based microservice using serverless architecture for a practical use case.
    2.Containerize Microservice: Containerize the microservice using Docker to ensure portability and ease of deployment.
    3.Deploy Microservice to a Free Tier Cloud Provider: Deploy the containerized microservice to a free tier cloud provider like AWS Free Tier or Google Cloud Free Tier.
    4.Implement DynamoDB Integration: Integrate DynamoDB as the database for storing data, considering the free tier limits.
    5.Establish CI/CD Pipeline: Create a CI/CD pipeline using free tools like GitHub Actions or GitLab CI to automate testing, building, and deployment processes.

Tasks:

    1.Choose Use Case: Select a practical use case for your microservice that would benefit developers or users globally.
    2.Develop Microservice: Write Python code to implement the microservice functionality, ensuring it's well-documented and follows best practices.
    3.Containerize Microservice: Create a Dockerfile to package the microservice into a container image, ensuring it's optimized for performance and resource usage.
    4.Deploy to Free Tier Cloud Provider: Use the free tier services of AWS or Google Cloud Platform to deploy the microservice, ensuring it remains within the usage limits to avoid charges.
    5.Integrate DynamoDB: Implement functionality to interact with DynamoDB for data storage and retrieval, optimizing usage to stay within the free tier limits.
    6.Set up CI/CD Pipeline: Configure a CI/CD pipeline using free tools like GitHub Actions or GitLab CI to automate testing, building Docker image, and deploying the microservice.

Bonus Tasks (Optional):

    Write comprehensive documentation and create tutorials to help users understand and utilize your microservice effectively.
    Foster a community around your project by encouraging contributions from other developers and providing support through forums or chat channels.
    Explore additional free services or tools that can enhance the functionality or development workflow of your microservice.
    Continuously improve and iterate upon your microservice based on community feedback and emerging technologies.
